# This document is used to explain the operation of the entire project
# Purpose: Determine the most likely reaction site of a compound (only one is determined because chemistry emphasizes the highest selectivity)
# This project has a total of 6 documents, including data processing, descriptor generation, and specific models

# Dataset: directly the SMILES text .txt file constructed by yourself, first generate the gjf file from smiles for Gaussian
